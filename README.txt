This project implements the K-means clustering, which is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. 
This algorithmis tested by clustering the pixels of an image and producing a new segmented image.

First, you need to compile the Main.java file. In the console, you can choose 0 if you want to test the project using the default parameters
or one if you want to choose them. In the default mode, the segmented image will be an image of a tiger, which can be found in the repository. 
The segmentation uses the Euclidean distance with k=4 and saves the segmented image in a new file called "tiger-kmeans" in the same folder.
The segmented image will be then opened.

If you tap 1 then you'll have to enter the parameters one by one following the instructions. First, you enter the name of the image with its 
extension, k the number of clusters, and finally 0 for the euclidean distance and 1 for the Chebyshev distance.
